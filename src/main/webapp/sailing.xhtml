        <h:outputText styleClass="template_tip" value="Please create a page for each Quality Indicator within your Module. 
                      These pages should clearly explain the purpose of the Indicator and what it is trying to measure."/>
        <p>
            Purpose of the Quality Indicator:<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Measures the days that are good for a pleasurable sail on Betsie Bay and Lake Michigan. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            Denominator Conditions:
            <ol>
                <li>True if Observation was from the sailing season April - October.</li>
            </ol>
            Numerator Conditions:<br/>
            True if all the conditions are satisfied.
            <ol>
                <li>The Temperature must be greater the 50 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Winds speed must be between 3 and 35 knots.</li>
            </ol>
            I know there are many other points of data such as wave height, precipitation etc... However, this is only an example.
