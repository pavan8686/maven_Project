            In the late 1980's I was stationed at a Coast Guard Station in Frankfort Michigan. Multiple times a day we had Sailers and Hand Glider pilots
            call asking about the weather. <br/>
            The data model for this application was generated from the <a href="http://www.weather.gov/view/current_observation.xsd" target="blank">Current Observation xsd</a> of the 
            <a href="http://w1.weather.gov/" target="blank">National Weather Service</a><br/>
            This model was chosen because it is simple enough for everyone to understand, complex enough to generate a good model,
            and provides a good chance for users to alter the code for their own preferences and location.
        </p>
        <p>The data for the xmlPayload for the test was pulled from <a href="http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KFKS.xml" target="blank">http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KFKS.xml</a></p>
